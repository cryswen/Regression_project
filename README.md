Regression analysis on Vertaeon energy performance.

Exploratory data analysis selected 5 significant predictors. Factorization was performed to deal with
missing data. Interactions of predictors were added to the model after correlation matrix was evaluated.

Model selection based on step-wise BIC and Lasso methods. Model was validated by leave one out and
6-fold cross validation. The final model achieved an adjusted cross-validation estimate of 0.0028.
